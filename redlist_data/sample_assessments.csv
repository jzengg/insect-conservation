It is most common in clearer, firmer bottomed streams; occurrence over soft substrates is most typical in the lower Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain. Rarely is it found naturally in impoundments. In the upper Coastal Plain, it occupies stained flowing waters lined with swamps (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). In the upper Piedmont, adults and large juveniles are in deep runs, in the current-swept heads of pools, and sometimes in the calm parts of pools (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). The young probably occur well under cover in calm water (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). In hatchery ponds, nests were constructed and guarded by males in shallow water on gravel; sand and muck substrates were avoided.","Decline of this species is attributed to impoundment, pollution, competition with introduced populations of rock bass (<em>A. rupestris</em>), and adverse spring stream conditions in certain years (Petrimoulx 1983).

It is common in parts of its range. Adults inhabit the  continental  shelf over sandy or muddy bottoms, and juveniles can be found in   estuaries. Unpublished data indicate that this species may be a junior synonym of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus cheesmani</span>, and there is taxonomic confusion in several species of the genus including<span style=""font-style: italic;""> L. cheesemanii</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri, L. spadiceus</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. wheeleri</span>. <em>Lagocephalus&#160;gloveri</em> is a popular food fish in China, Taiwan and Japan. There is little species-specific population information available. This species is non-toxic and safe for consumption as processed and fresh fish product. It appears to be landed in large quantities in parts of its range, but does not appear to be particularly valuable. Based on population trends seen in other species of commercially important pufferfishes it is inferred that this species is undergoing population declines in parts of its range. It is also likely to be impacted by coastal habitat degradation, particularly near estuaries and river  mouths. Suspected population declines from exploitation and habitat degradation are not quantifiable and therefore do not meet the thresholds for a threatened category.&#160;Pending clarification concerning this species' distribution and population status, this species is assessed as Data Deficient.&#160;The taxonomy of this and several other species of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus</span> remains unresolved.<br/><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""></span>","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> is a tropical species found at depths ranging from 0-100 m. Adults inhabit the continental shelf where they are found over sandy or muddy bottoms. Juveniles can be found in estuaries (Matsuura and Liu pers comm. 2011). <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> feeds on molluscs, crustaceans and fishes. It is most similar to <em>L. spadiceus</em> and <em>L. guentheri </em>in appearance (Matsuura <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p>Puffers of the genus <em>Lagocephalus</em> are globally distributed in warm shallow waters, however classification at the species level in <em>Lagocephalus</em> has not yet been studied in depth, causing confusion in the status of several species including <em>L. cheesemanii</em>, <em>L. gloveri</em>, <em>L. spadiceus</em>, and <em>L. wheeleri </em>(Matsuura <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","<strong>Pufferfish fishery<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagocephalus gloveri</span> is impacted by pufferfish fisheries in parts of its range. In Japan, Pufferfish landings have declined since the early 1990s. Concern about the fishery centers on the most valuable and preferred species, <em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;which, as of 2010, was considered depleted in Japan.<em> </em>Landings of <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in Japan had declined to 5% of annual landings in 1987. Landings of ""other pufferfish"", a category which includes <em>L. gloveri, </em>were maximized after the decline in <em>T. rubripes </em>landings. These ""other pufferfish"" have declined from a peak of roughly 400 tonnes in 1999 to less than 100 tonnes in 2007, a decline of roughly 75%. Declines in landings have been attributed to the effects of highly-effective long-line fishing (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/>Fishery-dependent data from China showed declines in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of<em> L. gloveri</em> from 2001 to 2003, however this data may represent several species of this genus. In the Zhoushan Islands <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri</span> contributed about 15% of the total salted/dried tetraodontiform fish products found in markets. In northern Taiwan, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">L. gloveri</span> accounted for 80% of the tetraodontiform fish capture volume (uncited/unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat degradation<br/></strong>Furthermore, habitat degradation is occurring in many coastal areas within this species' range, particularly near river mouths (J. Liu pers. comm. 2011). In the semi-enclosed regions of the North Bohai and Yellow Seas, large amounts of industrial and municipal effluents containing heavy metals, particularly arsenic, have been implicated in the deterioration of coastal environments (Luo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Heavy metals have also been implicated in the degradation of the heavily populated and industrialized Pearl River delta region in southern China (Cheung <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the Gulf of Thailand, coastal habitat degradation has resulted from pollution, primarily from untreated municipal and industrial waste water, as well as a rapid decrease in mangrove forests, coral reefs, and fisheries resources (Cheevaporn and Menasveta 2003).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagacephalus gloveri</span> is common and can be locally abundant (K. Matsuura and L. Jing pers. comm. 2011). It is common in Taiwan (Shao pers. comm. 2011) and in the east China Sea (M. Liu and J.

While no species-specific regulations are known to be in place for <em>L. gloveri</em>, management efforts targeting the fishery as a whole are likely to positively impact this species. On a regional scale, the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1999 resulted in fisheries agreements reached between Japan, South Korea, and China. These agreements restructured fishery management by giving coastal countries the ability to regulate foreign fishing vessels. The Fisheries Agency of Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which led to the establishment of an off-fishing season, restriction on minimum body size, improvements to fishing grounds, and other measures. The plan was extended past 2010 to 2012 due to the failure of <em>L. gloveri</em> to recover (Kawata 2012).</p><p><strong>Other conservation measures</strong><br/>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>L. gloveri</em>, however its distribution overlaps with several marine protected areas.</p>","",,false,false,Global
